(CNN)After publicly sounding the alarm about Russia's irregular military movements near Ukraine's border, the Biden administration's efforts to understand Russia's intentions are being hampered by a key blind spot -- the intelligence community's limited visibility into Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.

"The intelligence community's job in Russia has gotten progressively difficult," said one congressional source regularly briefed on the intelligence. "It's moving toward what you would call a denied area."
US officials have said publicly in recent days that they don't yet know what Russia's intentions are -- privately, they say that is largely because of a lack of intelligence on discussions between Putin, who will decide whether to attempt to invade Ukraine, and his inner circle
"We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a joint press conference at the State Department on Wednesday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken added that Russia's recent movements were reminiscent of its invasion of Crimea in 2014.
