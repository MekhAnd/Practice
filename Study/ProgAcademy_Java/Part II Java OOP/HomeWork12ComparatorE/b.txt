The Defense Department is also trying to understand Russia's end goal, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said last week. "What we continue to see is unusual military activity inside Russia but near Ukraine's borders, and we remain concerned about that, and it's not exactly clear what the Russian intentions are, we obviously would like to better understand that," Kirby said.
Sources familiar with the intelligence say it is not yet clear whether Russia intends to launch an invasion into Ukraine. But they note the trend lines are unsettling. Officials say the presence of Spetsnaz special forces and GRU and SVR intelligence operatives on the ground has increased concerns about the seriousness of Russia's actions and expands their capabilities to a full range of hybrid warfare tactics.
